## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
Following the stock market can be a tricky thing to do, especially for those who have not made it a part of their career. Staying on top of
one's investments can take time, and it's easy to forget to check up on one's portfolio. This program is meant to assist in that process, by 
sending a text message to users every day when markets open, providing recent news summaries for all tickers followed, as well as their price
fluctuations over a given time period.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Twilio API
- PythonAnywhere


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Allows users to easily alter tickers they wish to follow, how often messages are sent, and the interval over which price fluctuations should 
be measured
- Messaging process is automated through PythonAnywhere


## Usage
Set up tickers you wish to keep tabs on under `STOCK_NAME`, and alter variables such as `PHONE_NUMBER` with that which messages should be sent to
